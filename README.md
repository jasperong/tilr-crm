# Tilr CRM

This is a very simple CRM app created for Tilr's coding challenge.

### Notes

- Rails 5
- Ruby 2.3.1

### Features

- Oauth sign in
- Live seach for contacts (buggy)
- Sort by name or company
- Tag by favorite, family, friend, or colleague
- Import contacts from gmail, (very buggy, but somehow works)


# TODO

- Contact import from Google VERY buggy for now

- Fix first_name and last_name sorting

- For some reason, sorting by name orders contacts in a weird way, however, company sorting works just fine

- Bug: Live Search doesn't work after clicking HOME button, but works on refreshing home page
